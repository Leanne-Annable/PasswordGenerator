# PasswordGenerator

## Description 

This website allows the user to generate a password by accepting or denying certain criteria.


## Usage 

To use the password generator you simply click the button on the main page.
Upon doing so, a number of prompts will appear asking you to type the length of password you require (no less than 10 or more than 64)
You will then be asked four questions, each of which you can click either 'OK' for yes or 'Cancel' for no.
You will be asked if you want to include lower and upper case letters, numbers, special characters/symbols.
When the options have been selected, the newly generated random password will appear in the main box.
You can then click the button again to go through the questions again and generate a new password.
